# AsynchronousEvents

Difference between synchronous and Asynchronous :
**Synchronous**: 
synchronous means that code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous istruction to complete its execution.
**Asynchronous** : Asynchronous means code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesnt block the flow.

>javascript supports asynchronous only.
